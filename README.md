# Neural networks demo

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Totemi1324/neural-networks-demo/HEAD)

A small, interactive demo to machine learning with deep neural networks (DNNs) using Tensorflow + Keras. Browse through the `examples` folder to view a list of topics covered.

There are two ways to get the Jupyter notebooks running:

## 1. Launch on Binder (recommended)

Open this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Totemi1324/neural-networks-demo/HEAD) to get a fully set-up environment in your browser.

## 2. Launch with Google Colab

Clone the repo to your local machine, visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload the notebook files to execute them in a browser environment.

## 3. Execute locally

If you have Python and a suitable IDE installed, just clone the repo and install the required packages with `pip`:

```
$ cd neural-networks-demo
# Activate your virtualenv beforehand if necessary!
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
